```lrc
[00:00.15] The town inside me and everyone's voice
[00:05.86] Only I'm not there, just watching from afar
[00:27.36] 
[00:11.12] I can't go home because I'm afraid
[00:14.75] Something will change, me without me
[00:20.63] I'm the one to blame
[00:30.63] 
[00:29.62] I've moved on, by my own will
[00:32.64] (I had nothing else I wanted to do)
[00:35.30] It wasn't hard, but I didn't hate it
[00:38.50] (I did not even like it)
[00:50.50] 
[00:39.92] I've been patient, but it was bearable
[00:42.72] I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)
[00:46.33] I never found out, what it was, I
[00:49.29] It's my stress, that's for sure
[01:04.79] 
[00:52.38] I never wanted to run away
[00:55.37] (I was very motivated)
[00:58.35] Then what is this feeling?
[01:00.60] (Who would I ask?)
[01:09.60] 
[01:02.63] I've been patient, but it was bearable
[01:05.74] I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)
[01:09.46] I never found out, what it was, I
[01:11.99] Tastes like vegetables I don't like
[01:29.49] 
[01:15.08] The town inside me and everyone's voice
[01:20.90] Only I'm not there, just watching from afar
[01:42.40] 
[01:26.19] I can't go home because I'm afraid
[01:29.36] Something will change, me without me
[01:35.34] I'm the one to blame
[01:45.34] 
[01:44.59] I'm not waiting (for a Santa Claus)
[01:50.29] I already have the gifts, just can't open the box
[01:53.53] (Just can't open the box)
[02:06.03] 
[01:56.10] I know all about it, no one can stop it
[02:01.56] Unless I just had to do something 'bout it
[02:04.69] "It's not even a case!"
[02:16.19] 
[02:06.37] I've been patient, but it was bearable
[02:09.19] I've had a gray haze for a long time though (boom-boom)
[02:12.84] I never found out, what it was, I
[02:15.70] I hate the alarm clock I chose
[02:30.70] 
[02:18.61] The town inside me and everyone's voice
[02:24.20] Only I'm not there, just watching from afar
[02:45.70] 
[02:29.61] I can't go home because I'm afraid
[02:33.12] Something will change, me without me
[02:38.80] I'm the one to blame
[02:48.80] 
[03:04.03] I'm out of patience, my body is light
[03:06.95] Let's paint the gray haze into sky blue
[03:10.40] I know who you are!
[03:13.62] I'm not leaving you again!
[03:26.62] 
[03:19.32] The town inside me and everyone's voice
[03:25.15] Only I'm not there, just watching from afar
[03:46.65] 
[03:30.42] There is nowhere to go that, nowhere to go
[03:33.66] It's all just food y'know
[03:37.30] Me without me (I'm the one to blame)
[03:42.39] The night falls, the place where I belong
[04:02.89] 
[03:48.15] No matter what changes, will no longer change me
[03:53.28] No matter what (change), no, no, no, won't change me
[03:59.89] I can feel the light, even after the sun goes down
